Got it. Here’s a crisp brand-to-dashboard style guide based on the logo and site shots you shared (BAMBOOM+).

Brand essence

Mood: calm, natural, premium, “designed in Italy.”

Personality: soft, caring, eco-conscious, confident but not loud.

Visual rhythm: lots of air/whitespace, centered compositions, gentle contrast.

Color system (proposed tokens)

Match these to the exact brand values if you have them—these are faithful approximations to what I see.

Ink / Primary: #111111 (wordmark / primary text)

Sage / Accent: #BFC9C2 (the site’s soft green)

Moss / Accent-darker: #8EA395

Cream / Canvas: #F5F2ED (backgrounds behind images/sections)

Warm Gray / Subtext: #8E8E8E

Line / Divider: #E6E4E0

Data viz accents (use sparingly, 1–2 per chart):

Leaf: #9FB7A5

Clay: #C9B3A3

Dusk: #94A3AF

Typography

Headlines (brand feel): elegant serif with soft contrast.
Options: Cormorant Garamond, Playfair Display, Fraunces (optical size friendly).

UI & body (readability): humanist/geometric sans.
Options: Inter, Source Sans 3, Atkinson Hyperlegible.

Pairing example

H1/H2: Cormorant Garamond (600) — tracking slightly tight (-1%).

Body/UI: Inter (400/500) — line-height 1.5.

Layout & components

Whitespace: generous. Section paddings 40–64 px desktop, 24–32 px mobile.

Corners: subtle radius (6–8 px).

Shadows: very soft (ambient), e.g. 0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.06).

Borders: hairline 1px solid #E6E4E0 on cards/tables.

Buttons: primary = Ink text on Cream with outline; hover fills with Ink on Cream reverse. Secondary = ghost/underline.

Icons: thin line-icons (stroke 1.5 px), rounded ends.

Imagery

Palette: neutral & earthy, soft natural light.

Surfaces: fabric, wood, matte textures; avoid high-sat colors.

Framing: centered, breathing room, minimal props.

Tone of voice (UI copy)

Calm, warm, direct. Prefer verbs like View, Track, Compare.

Microcopy uses sentence case; no exclamation marks.

Dashboard guidance (for “Lolo”)

Overall goal: keep it serene and trustworthy; data should “sit” in the UI, not shout.

Navigation

Top app bar: white/cream with Ink text, 56–64 px height.

Left rail (if needed): icons + short labels; selected state = Ink with a Sage left border.

Cards

3–4 cards per row (desktop), each:

Padding 20–24 px; title in serif, metric in large sans.

Subtitle/Δ% in Warm Gray; positive = Moss (#8EA395), negative = Clay-red (#C98A82).

Tables

Zebra subtle with #FAF9F7.

Header: medium weight sans, Ink; cells 14 px, 48 px row height.

Hover row: background #F6F4F1.

Charts (minimalist)

Bar/line: single accent (Leaf), everything else grayscale.

Hide heavy gridlines; keep only Y major lines in #ECEAE6.

Axis labels 12–13 px, Warm Gray.

Legends inline, small dots.

Target lines (e.g., benchmarks): 1 px dashed #CFCAC3.

Status colors

Success: #86A892 (Moss)

Warning: #D1B38C (Wheat)

Error: #C98A82 (Clay-red)

Info: #94A3AF (Dusk)

Empty states / loaders

Gentle skeletons in #F0EEEA; short, friendly single-line guidance.
